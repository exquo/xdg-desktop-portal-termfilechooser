# nnn has no equivalent of ranger's:
	# `--cmd`
		# .. and no other way to show a message text on startup. So, no way to show instructions in nnn itself, like it is done in ranger-wrapper.
		# nnn also does not show previews (needs a plugin and a keypress). So, the save instructions in `$path` file are not shown automatically.
	# `--show-only-dirs`
	# `--choosedir`
		# Navigating to a dir and quitting nnn would not write it to the selection file. To select a dir, use <Space> on a dir name, then quit nnn.
		# Although it might be possible to write a script using https://github.com/jarun/nnn/wiki/Basic-use-cases#configure-cd-on-quit
	# However it might be possible to implement all of the above with a plugin for nnn.
